# Module-one-Challenge 
Purpose is to complete the challenge and resolve the ask in the given criteria
The code used was pulled from GITLAB from UTSA Bootcamp and is located in the module-Challenge-One repository
The HTML text was changed to remove the DIV element with more apppropriate uses such as header,nav,main,footer and section to follow semantics and improve code
The site was not adjusted but only improved upon based on the new elements that were used
Some attributes were removed as the element alone was enough
![img1](./Readmeimg.png) i changed three lines of HTML that used different classes to one class called "services" to consolidate.
The same changes was made to the benefit, benefit h3 and benefit img to reduce the same contents into a single class
![img2](./Readmeimg2.png) Elements that were changed were used to define the style and class were removed as it was not necessary for the change.
The modified code keeps the application intact without disrupting or changing the view and purpose of its original code
The end goal developed a cleaner code format and better optimization
